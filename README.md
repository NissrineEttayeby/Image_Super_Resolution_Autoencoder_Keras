## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of an image super-resolution application using an autoencoder neural network built with Keras. It enables users to upscale low-resolution images to higher resolutions, enhancing their visual quality.

The super-resolution technique employed in this project utilizes deep learning to learn high-frequency details from a dataset of high-resolution images and applies that knowledge to upsample low-resolution images effectively.

## Features

- Super-resolve low-resolution images to higher resolutions.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface for image upscaling.
- Customizable scaling factor for image enhancement.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.6 or higher and the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install keras tensorflow numpy
